### Gradle Cache Issues (Android) and Pod Issues (iOS)  
  
#### Why Deleting `node_modules` and Running `npm install && npx expo prebuild` Didn't Work  
When working with Expo and native builds, simply deleting `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `.expo` files, and regenerating the `android` or `ios` folder doesn't fully address issues caused by **stale native build artifacts**. Here’s why:  
  
---  
  
### **1. What `npx expo prebuild` Does**  
The `expo prebuild` command:  
- Regenerates native project files (e.g., `android` and `ios` folders).  
- Autolinks native dependencies (e.g., `expo-linking`).  
  
However, it **doesn't clean native build artifacts** created by Gradle or CocoaPods, which are cached in locations outside the `android` or `ios` folders. These artifacts can cause build issues if they become stale or inconsistent after:  
- Updating native dependencies.  
- Switching JavaScript engines (e.g., Hermes vs. JSC).  
- Changing Gradle or Pod configurations.  
  
---  
  
### **2. Why `./gradlew clean` Was Needed**  
The `./gradlew clean` command:  
- Removes cached native build files and `.class` or `.dex` artifacts stored in the Gradle build cache.  
- Ensures Gradle recompiles all native dependencies from scratch during the next build.  
- Fixes issues caused by stale or corrupted build outputs.  
  
Without running `./gradlew clean`, the build system may continue using outdated or mismatched artifacts, leading to errors like:  
- `Cannot find native module 'ExpoLinking'`.

### **3. Equivalent Steps for iOS**  
For iOS builds, **CocoaPods** handles dependency management. Issues similar to Android's Gradle cache can arise if:  
- Stale Pods are used.  
- The Pod cache contains outdated files.  
  
To resolve these issues, you need to:  
1. Navigate to the `ios` folder:  
```bash  
cd ios  
```  
  
2. Run the following commands:  
- **Clear the CocoaPods cache**:  
```bash  
pod cache clean --all  
```  
- **Deintegrate and reinstall Pods**:  
```bash  
pod deintegrate  
pod install  
```  
  
3. Clean the Xcode build folder:  
- Open Xcode.  
- Select **Product > Clean Build Folder** (`Cmd + Shift + K`).  
  
4. Rebuild the iOS app:  
```bash  
npx expo run:ios  
```

### **4. How to Avoid This Issue**  
To minimize the need for manual cleaning:  
1. Always run `./gradlew clean` (Android) or `pod cache clean && pod deintegrate && pod install` (iOS) after:  
- Adding/updating native dependencies.  
- Switching between JavaScript engines (Hermes vs. JSC).  
  
2. Automate the cleaning process with scripts:  
- **Android**:  
```bash  
# clean_android.sh  
rm -rf android  
expo prebuild  
cd android  
./gradlew clean  
cd ..  
npx expo run:android  
```  
- **iOS**:  
```bash  
# clean_ios.sh  
cd ios  
pod cache clean --all  
pod deintegrate  
pod install  
cd ..  
npx expo run:ios  
```  
  
3. Use Continuous Integration (CI) for fresh builds to ensure consistency across environments.

### **5. Key Lessons**  
- `npx expo prebuild` regenerates project files but doesn't clean cached native build outputs.  
- Stale Gradle or CocoaPods artifacts can persist across builds, causing errors.  
- Always clean the build environment after major changes to dependencies or configurations.

By following these steps, you can avoid common build issues for both Android and iOS
